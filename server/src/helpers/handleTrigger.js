/**

Triggers are additional event listeners attached to events which perform actions. 
These actions are defined in trigger groups and can potentially attach any event to a timeline action.
However, to make sure that triggers can provide the proper data for performing their 
function, we define them outside of the usual event handler in the `events` folder. 
Triggers should correspond with a configuration component defined in 
`/client/src/containers/FlightDirector/Triggers/components/triggers`
